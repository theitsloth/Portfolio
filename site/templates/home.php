Hello, and welcome to my porfolio page. I'm a mathematics
student who likes to program in my free time. <br>
I like to create web pages, and I make no compromises when it
comes to security. <br>
I am also comfortable with Linux servers, in fact, I'm responsible
for system administration and devops at Sitetech. <br>
For a complete list of the technologies I know, see
<a href="/about">About</a>.<br>
For a list of my previous and current projects, see
